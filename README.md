A text-based Python 2 & 3 implementation of the game [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors).

Game play:
 
        * each round, both players select from: rock, paper, or scissors 
        * rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock 
        * a player receives 1 point per round (s)he wins
        * 0 points for ties 
        * user defines number of rounds for gameplay 

## Usage 
To run directly from a shell: 
`python rock_scissor_paper_2.0.py` or `python3 rock_scissor_paper_2.0.py` 

Menu driven program. Each round player is prompted for input. Program determines victor, while keeping cumulative score. Game is over when one player wins user defined number of rounds first.    

## Todo: 
- [x] Increase code efficiency. 
- [x] Add support for Python 3.
