        * rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock

        * 0 points for ties 
        * user defines number of rounds for gameplay

Menu driven program. Each round player is prompted for input. Program determines victor, while keeping cumulative score. Game is over when one player wins user defined number of rounds first.
